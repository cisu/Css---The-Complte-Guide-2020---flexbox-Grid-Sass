i can manipulate the text display new line ect by
 white-space property


    white-space: normal;
    
    white-space: nowrap;
    
    white-space: pre; 
    change the contect with actually line on html code (only) the overflow contect DOESN'T wrap
    
    white-space: pre-wrap;
    Same as above but the overflow contect wrap

    white-space: pre-line; Lines fill whenever possible but the hard code line on html does apply


    
    line-height: 1 or normal;
    By default, the line height depends on the font family e are using. If we change that behavior and add he line property with a value of two for example, then this will alwyas refer to the font size 

    font: italic small-caps 700 1.2rem/2 'AnonymousPro', sans-serif;
    
    font: font-style font-variant font-weight font-size/line-height font-family; 

    system font
    font: menu; display fonts which display as menu text
    font: status-bar; display fonts which display as menu text


    font-display
    swap: 

    block:

    fallback:

    optional: 

    auto: means that the browser our visitor is using will automatically choose a value of his choice
